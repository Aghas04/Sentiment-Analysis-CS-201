FORMATTED REVIEW: 
jennifer is very nice and responsive the location of the apt is great however  
the bed was small and smelled bad the apt also smelled weird we had to sleep on 
a mattress on the floor  the building is very old  the apt is not clean and due 
to construction it was very noisy however we do appreciate the stay and the 
location

FORMATTED REVIEW: 
garon is undoubtedly the most welcoming and nice host ever you feel at home 
right away he is exciting and passionate discussions are super interesting and 
he is extremely friendly a stay at his place is a good mood cure i highly 
recommend it was so nice staying at garons for the first glance it didnt look 
very fancy or something but this place is gorgeous from inside out its pretty 
easy to get to subway g train or if you walk a little more you can get to a 
train which goes directly to jfk airport garon is a very kind person very 
openminded and friendly we also have a lot in common in area of culture ill 
recommend this place to everyone who is openminded and want to feel how people 
live there in nyc neighborhood looked safe despite it was one of the coldest 
weeks for last year in town but heating worked well and the room was warm i had 
the most beautiful stay garon is a very special person and an absolute angel 
made me feel totally at home in a highly peaceful and relaxed environment i 
throughly recommend bliss art space
